I am an incoming MPhil student in Computer Science Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Currently, I am a research assistant in HKUST, working on LLM applications related to privacy law with [Dr. Haoran Li](https://hlibt.student.ust.hk/) and [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the fortune of working with [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) on backdoor attacks and adversary investigation. I have a broad research interests in robust machine learning, with a primary focus on privacy concerns in LLMs. 

If you have any questions about my work or would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact me via email (whuak at connect dot ust dot hk).
