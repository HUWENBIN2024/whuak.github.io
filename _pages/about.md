I am an incoming MPhil student in Computer Science Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). Currently, I am doing research in HKUST, working on building a LLM privacy guard with [Dr. Haoran Li](https://hlibt.student.ust.hk/). During my undergraduate studies, I had the fortune of working with [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) on inplanting undetectable backdoors in ML models. I have keen research interest in **LLM Reasoning and Safety**. Recently, I've been concentrating on enhancing **legal reasoning in LLMs** and developing **a safety guard for LLMs** based on that.


If you have any questions about my works or would like to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact me via email (whuak at connect dot ust dot hk).
