I am a yr-4 undergraduate student major in computer science at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). Currently, I am working with [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/) on backdoor attacks. I  am also working with [Haoran Li](https://hlibt.student.ust.hk/) on graph embedding inversion attack, advised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). I have a broad research interest in machine learning theory and application, with a primary focus on robust machine learning. During my undergraduate research, my main focus is on addressing security concerns throughout the entire pipeline of machine learning models, including data information leakage, training time integrity, and testing time integrity.

I will abtain my bachelor degree BEng in 2024 summer. I am looking for MPhil/PhD position!
