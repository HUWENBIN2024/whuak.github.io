## Project 1: DiffAdv: Generating an Adversarial Example for Any Given Image Using Diffusion Models [<a href="https://whuak.github.io/files/DiffAdv_Report.pdf">link</a>]
2023.10 - 2023.12
- Motivated by the lack of efficiency and scalability of black-box adversarial attacks, we generate adversarial samples using a diffusion model.
- Our preliminary results show a drop in the accuracy of the generated adversarial examples.

## Project 2: On the Role of Inductive Graph Reasoning on Improving Resilience against Backdoor Attacks to Commonsense Knowledge Graphs [<a href="https://whuak.github.io/files/COMP4222_Group2_CSKGAttack_Project__Copy_.pdf">link</a>]
2022.10 - 2022.12
- We investigated the role of inductive graph reasoning on improving the resilience of Commonsense Knowledge
Graph (CSKG) against backdoor attacks.
- The experiments indicated that there is a distribution shift in the prediction heads, and hence, inductive graph
reasoning can enhance the modelâ€™s resilience to some extent. Nevertheless, the impact is rather modest, as the
attack success rate remains virtually unchanged.

## Project 3: Face Mask Recognition [<a href="https://whuak.github.io/files/COMP5214_Report.pdf">link</a>]
2022.04 - 2022.06
- We have developed an object detection dataset, with five classes of face masks.
- We achieved an MAp of 95\%+ in mask detection with YOLOv5 and Faster-RCNN.
